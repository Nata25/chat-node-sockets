### Chat app with Node and Socket.io (+ React)

Training project (in progress).

- [x] The app welcomes new users joining the chat and informs others that new user has been joined.
- [x] The app notifies all users when somebody is leaving chat.
- [x] The app prints messages.
- [x] Users are able to share their current location.
- [ ] TBD

The alternative implementation with **React** is in a separate branch (launched with `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server` and `babel`, no out-of-the-box solutions like CRA).

To launch app in dev mode:

```
npm start
```
